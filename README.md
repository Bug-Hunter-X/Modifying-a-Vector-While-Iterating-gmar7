This repository demonstrates a common error in Rust: modifying a vector while iterating over it. The `bug.rs` file contains the buggy code, which attempts to iterate over a vector and modify it concurrently. This leads to undefined behavior because the iterator's internal state is invalidated by the modification. The `bugSolution.rs` demonstrates the correct way to handle this situation using a different approach that avoids data races and guarantees valid iteration.
